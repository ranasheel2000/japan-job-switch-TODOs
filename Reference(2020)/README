This folder contains reference/details which are useful while creating final tax return.
Note: These details are specific to 2020 and not 2021.
So change 2 to 3 wherever year has been used (2 represents 2020, 3 represents 2021 in showa)


Note: All the pdf files are taken from https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/individual/incometax_2020.htm
Please refer japan tax website for actual information. This is just for my personal reference only.
